# Unified MCP Simulation Server — Master Build Checklist (TDD Focus)

## 0. PROJECT PRINCIPLES

- [ ] **Determinism First:** All systems must produce identical output from identical seeds.
- [ ] **Schema-Driven Development:** Every tool input/output validated using Zod schemas.
- [ ] **TDD Driven:** All functionality must be introduced *through tests first*.
- [ ] **Structured, LLM-Safe:** Map editing, world generation, and combat use strict typed structures.
- [ ] **Small Surface Area:** Build minimal valuable components before expanding.
- [ ] **Multi-Transport Stability:** Support stdio, Unix socket, and TCP from day one.
- [ ] **Zero Hidden State:** All state must be explicit in storage, logs, or schemas.
- [ ] **Replayable:** Every operation yields deterministic event logs.

### 0.1 CODE REVIEW SAFETY CHECKLIST

Before marking any phase as complete, ALL code must pass this checklist:

#### ✅ Determinism Safety
- [ ] No `Math.random()` anywhere in codebase (use seedable PRNG)
- [ ] No `Date.now()` or `new Date()` in production code (use seed-derived time)
- [ ] Test fixtures use deterministic constants (`FIXED_TIMESTAMP = '2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z'`)
- [ ] No floating global state or side effects

#### ✅ Schema Safety
- [ ] All I/O validated by Zod schemas (no unvalidated data paths)
- [ ] NEVER use `z.any()` (use `z.unknown()` with runtime validation instead)
- [ ] All types derived from schemas via `z.infer<>` (no manual type drift)
- [ ] Integer fields use `.int()` validation (hp, stats, coordinates, counts)
- [ ] Numeric fields have reasonable `.min()` and `.max()` bounds
- [ ] Enums defined in schemas match database CHECK constraints

#### ✅ Type Safety
- [ ] No `as any` type assertions (define proper typed interfaces)
- [ ] No silent coercions (e.g., `Number(x)` without validation)
- [ ] Database result types explicitly defined (no untyped SQL)
- [ ] Type guards used for discriminated unions (e.g., `isNPC()` helper)

#### ✅ Test Coverage
- [ ] Tests written BEFORE implementation (TDD discipline)
- [ ] Positive test cases (happy path)
- [ ] Negative test cases (invalid inputs, missing records, constraint violations)
- [ ] Edge cases (empty arrays, boundary values, multiple items)
- [ ] All tests use deterministic fixtures

#### ✅ Repository Pattern
- [ ] Input validation before DB writes (parse incoming data)
- [ ] Output validation after DB reads (parse outgoing data)
- [ ] Proper NULL handling for optional fields
- [ ] No logic in migrations (migrations are schema-only)

#### ✅ Database Integrity
- [ ] Foreign key constraints match schema relationships
- [ ] CHECK constraints enforce enum values
- [ ] NOT NULL constraints mirror required Zod fields
- [ ] Unique constraints prevent duplicate records
- [ ] ON DELETE CASCADE for dependent entities

#### ✅ Code Quality
- [ ] No duplicated logic (extract to helper functions)
- [ ] Clear variable naming matching domain concepts
- [ ] Module boundaries respected (correct folder placement)
- [ ] Public API exports tested
- [ ] No dead code or commented-out logic

### 0.2 REFLECTION PROTOCOL

After completing each major phase (Schema, Storage, World Gen, Combat, MCP):

1. **Run Full Test Suite** — All tests must pass green
2. **Run Code Review Checklist** — Address all blocking issues
3. **Document Learnings** — Add reflection section to Task Map
4. **Fix Blockers Before Proceeding** — No phase advancement until clean
5. **Update Best Practices** — Incorporate new patterns discovered
