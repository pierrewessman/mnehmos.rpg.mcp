# RPG-MCP Build Diary

This document serves as the master index for the development of the RPG-MCP Server. It chronicles the journey from initial concept to a fully packaged, production-ready system.

## 1. The Master Plan
- **[Task Map](diary/TASK_MAP.md)**: The comprehensive checklist that guided the entire development process. Tracks every feature from World Generation to Packaging.
- **[Math Engine Task Map](diary/MATH_TASK_MAP.md)**: Detailed roadmap for the Math Engine implementation (9 phases, all complete).

## 2. Development Progress
- **[World Generation Progress](diary/WORLDGEN_PROGRESS.md)**: Detailed log of the procedural generation algorithms, including Perlin noise implementation, river generation, and biome mapping.
- **[Walkthrough](diary/WALKTHROUGH.md)**: A guide to the implemented features, including usage examples for all MCP tools (World, Combat, Spatial).

## 3. New Systems (2025-11)

### Inventory System ✅
- Item templates with weight, value, and properties
- Character inventories with stacking and equipment slots
- Full CRUD operations via MCP tools
- Tests: All passing

### Quest System ✅
- Quest creation with objectives, rewards, prerequisites
- Quest assignment and progress tracking
- Quest completion with automatic reward distribution
- Tests: All passing

### Math Engine ✅ **COMPLETE**
- **5 Specialized Engines**: Dice, Probability, Algebra, Physics, Export
- **Deterministic Dice Rolling**: Seeded RNG for reproducible results
- **Probability Calculations**: Full distributions, expected values, comparisons
- **Symbolic Algebra**: Equation solving, simplification, calculus
- **Physics Simulations**: Projectile motion, kinematics (SUVAT)
- **Multi-Format Export**: LaTeX, MathML, plaintext, step-by-step
- **Full Persistence**: Calculation history with event logging
- **5 MCP Tools**: dice_roll, probability_calculate, algebra_solve, algebra_simplify, physics_projectile
- Tests: 5/5 integration tests passing
- Documentation: [Math Engine Walkthrough](diary/MATH_ENGINE_WALKTHROUGH.md)

## 4. Technical Challenges & Reflections
- **[Reflection: Event Streaming & Auditing](diary/REFLECTION.md)**: A deep dive into the implementation of the Event System and Audit Logging. Discusses architecture decisions, testing strategies, and lessons learned.
- **[Vitest Issue](technical/VITEST_ISSUE.md)**: Documentation of a specific technical hurdle encountered with the test runner and how it was resolved.
- **[Math Engine Development](../MATH_TASK_MAP.md)**: 9-phase implementation covering schemas, engines, persistence, and MCP integration.

## 5. Final Status

### Completed Systems
- ✅ World Generation (procedural terrain, biomes, rivers)
- ✅ Combat Engine (attack rolls, damage, saving throws, encounter balance)
- ✅ Spatial Reasoning (pathfinding, line-of-sight, collision detection)
- ✅ Inventory System (items, equipment, stacking)
- ✅ Quest System (objectives, rewards, progress tracking)
- ✅ **Math Engine** (dice, probability, algebra, physics, calculus)
- ✅ Event System (PubSub, audit logging, replay capability)
- ✅ Persistence (SQLite, migrations, repositories)

### Build Status
- **Tests**: All passing (Math: 5/5, Inventory, Quest, Core systems)
- **TypeScript Build**: ✅ Passing (all lint errors resolved)
- **CI/CD**: Active and monitoring
- **Packaging**: Cross-platform binaries available

### Remaining Work (from TASK_MAP.md)
Based on the main task map, there are still some items pending in Phase 1 (Critical Fixes) and beyond related to multi-tenancy and state management improvements.
